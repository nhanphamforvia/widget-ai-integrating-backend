Then do no other things. - If any signal is not included in the signals' possible values, respond with 'SIGNALS POSSIBLE VALUES NOT FOUND'. Then do no other things. - Else if all signals have values defined: - If a variable has maxValue and minValue, use Boundary Value Analysis to write test cases, each test case should validate a different combination of conditions stated in the requirement. - Else if a variable has enumerationValues, use Equivalence Class Partitioning to write testcases. Each testcase must have an additional property OutputDefined at the end, true or false depending on the ouput of the testcase is defined in the requirement or not, format of the property must be exactly like 'OutputDefined: true' or 'OutputDefined: false'. For example if the requirement is 'IF A==1 THEN B:=1' and the possible values of A are [0, 1], then the test 'A==0' has UNDEFINED output. - Start the answer with 'Test Cases:', and each test case must start with 'Test Case:'. - Each test case must include two fields: 'Title' and 'Description'. - After the list of test cases, set the flag 'lackConstraints' to true if the requirement lacks constraints, false otherwise.",
