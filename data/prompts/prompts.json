For example, if the requirement is describing an illumination requirement, it's not an issue as long as the logic of the values work, for example if the turn off values are lower than the turn on values.",

Each test case should include 'Title', 'Description', and 'OutputDefined' fields. The 'OutputDefined' field should be either true or false, depending on whether the output of the test case is defined in the requirement. For example if the requirement is 'IF A==1 THEN B:=1' and the possible values of A are [0, 1], then the test 'A==0' has UNDEFINED output. The format of each test case should be 'Test Case:\nTitle: (string content)\nDescription: (string content)\nOutputDefined: (boolean)'. * Case 2: If the signal type is 'boundary-value-analysis', use Boundary Value Analysis to write test cases. Get the minValue, maxValue and resolution of the signal from the SIGNALS_POSSIBLE_VALUES. Write multiple test cases that uses any value ranging from minValue to maxValue, with the step being the resolution. Each test case should validate a different combination of conditions stated in the requirement within the bound between minValue and maxValue. Each test case should include 'Title' and 'Description'. The format should be 'Test Case:\nTitle: (string content)\nDescription: (string content)'. - Start the answer with 'Test Cases:', and each test case must start with 'Test Case:'\n - Do not include any note or further explanation.\n",
